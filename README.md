# Home-Loan-Prediction
## Overview
This project focuses on predicting home loan approval using machine learning techniques. The main objective is to create a model that can accurately predict whether a loan application will be approved or not. The project includes several key steps such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model selection, tuning, and evaluation.

## Project Highlights
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and understand its characteristics.
Performed univariate and bivariate analysis to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in the data.
Handled outliers using appropriate techniques to ensure the robustness of the predictive models.
Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to remove missing values and prepare it for modeling.
Created a pipeline for the models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest classifiers.
Utilized GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Evaluated the models using F1 score, a suitable metric for imbalanced classification tasks.

## Data
The dataset consists of various features related to loan applicants, including personal, financial, and property-related attributes. The target variable is whether a loan was approved or not. The data is used to train and evaluate predictive models for loan approval.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA was performed to understand the distribution of variables, detect outliers, and explore relationships between features and loan approval status. Visualizations were generated to provide insights into the dataset's characteristics.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical features. Outliers were treated using appropriate methods to enhance model performance and generalization.

## Model Selection
Multiple classification algorithms were explored, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest. Each algorithm was evaluated in terms of its ability to predict loan approval accurately.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the models was evaluated using the F1 score, which considers both precision and recall. The F1 score is particularly relevant for imbalanced classification tasks like loan approval prediction. GridSearch was employed for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model parameters.

## Conclusion
This project aimed to predict home loan approval using machine learning techniques. By conducting EDA, data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation, we were able to create predictive models that provide insights into loan approval outcomes. The F1 score was used to assess model performance, resulting in an accurate and robust loan approval prediction system.
